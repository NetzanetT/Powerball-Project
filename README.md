# Powerball-Project

How does the Powerball game work in this assignment?
•	The Powerball game in this assignment works differently from the real one like Mega Millions to get more chances to get favorite results. 
•	The Powerball game includes two parts. 
o	Part one includes 5 numbers. These five numbers are white ball numbers, which are drawn randomly from 20 numbers from 1 to 20 inclusively - (1,2,3, 4, 5, … , 17,18,19, 20). 
o	Part two only has one number, the Powerball number, which is obtained randomly from 10 numbers (1,2,3,4, 5,6,7,8, 9,10). 
•	When your program/page is run or reloaded/refreshed, it would display today’s 	Powerball winning numbers, your lucky numbers, and display the result based on your lucky numbers against Today’s Powerball winning numbers.
